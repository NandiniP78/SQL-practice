--8. List all employees and the projects they are working on (including those without projects).
select e.name, p.project_name 
from employees e
left join employeeprojects ep on e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
left join projects p on ep.project_id = p.project_id

--9. Show all departments and the projects under them, even if some departments have no projects.

from employees e
left join employees m on (e.manager_id = m.emp_id)

--14. Get a list of all departments and include the department name even if it has no employees and no projects.

--16. Get a list of employees with their latest bonus received.
SELECT *
FROM salaries s1

GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.project_id) = COUNT(DISTINCT ep.project_id);

--19. Use a CTE to find average bonus per employee and join it to show name, salary, and avg bonus.
with AvgBonus as
	(select emp_id, avg(bonus) as avg_bonus
	from salaries
	group by emp_id)
select e.name,e.salary,ab.avg_bonus

left join AvgBonus ab on e.emp_id = ab.emp_id

--20. Create a full outer join to list all employee and department combinations (even if unrelated).
select *

--22. Identify employees who earn more than the highest paid employee in HR.
select *
from employees 
where salary > (select max(salary)
				from employees e
				join departments d on e.dept_id = d.dept_id
				where d.dept_name = 'HR' )

--23. For each department, find the employee with the highest bonus.
SELECT d.dept_name, e.name, s.bonus

JOIN Employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE (e.emp_id, s.bonus) IN (
    SELECT e2.emp_id, MAX(s2.bonus)
    FROM Employees e2
    JOIN Salaries s2 ON e2.emp_id = s2.emp_id
    GROUP BY e2.dept_id
);

--24. Use INTERSECT to find employees who have both worked on Project A and Project B.
SELECT ep1.emp_id
FROM EmployeeProjects ep1
JOIN Projects p1 ON ep1.project_id = p1.project_id AND p1.project_name = 'Recruitment Drive'
INTERSECT
SELECT ep2.emp_id
FROM EmployeeProjects ep2
JOIN Projects p2 ON ep2.project_id = p2.project_id AND p2.project_name = 'Website Redesign';

--25. List employees who are in the same department and also work on the same projects (self join on both).
SELECT e1.name AS emp1, e2.name AS emp2, p.project_name
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.dept_id = e2.dept_id AND e1.emp_id < e2.emp_id
JOIN EmployeeProjects ep1 ON e1.emp_id = ep1.emp_id
JOIN EmployeeProjects ep2 ON e2.emp_id = ep2.emp_id AND ep1.project_id = ep2.project_id
JOIN Projects p ON ep1.project_id = p.project_id;
